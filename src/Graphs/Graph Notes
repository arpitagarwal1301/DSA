Vocabulary
-Vertex
-Edge


Undirected

vertex{
    char ch;
    boolean visited;
}

DFS(inorder sort of tree) , BFS(like level order of tree)
-It is similar to dfs and bfs of tree but the only diff. is it can have cycles so we use isVisited boolean key

Topological sort
- it should be Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)
Eg. build systems
 * parent <- apache , child <- apache POI.
 * api - get unisystem
 * ide


Spanning tree
- Edges - n-1 (where n is #vertex)

Minimum spanning tree (Prism's Algorithm)
- acyclic,undirected
- construct the table for solving
- calculate vertex with min value
- add to mst


Shortest Path ( Dijkastra's Algo)
- acyclic , undirected
- Distance = current + distance
- similar to mim. spanning tree
- LIMITATION - IMP. will not support negative algorithm

Shortest Path (Bellmond Ford)
- Strictly directed graph
- Diff. with dijkastra as we have to run the dijkastras V-1 times in this thing
- (Imp.) THis algo can be used to identify negative cycle - If on Vth iteration it is reducing the distance
  it is a negative cycle .


Graph Coloring
- No adjacent vertices have same color
- Min. no of colors for coloring the graph
- Chromatic no = no of min. colors required
