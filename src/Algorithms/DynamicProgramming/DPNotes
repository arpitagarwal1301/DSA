DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING NOTES

Reasons for dp over recursion
- multiple calculations of same problem
- for eg. fibonacchi for f(3) we are again calculation f(2) and f(1)

What dp do
- save the results of sub problems for later use


Approaches
- Top down approach (Memorization)
- Bottom up approach (Tabulization)


Top down(Memorization)
- break problem into subproblems save it and store the result
- just take an array to store the result and use it...its simple

 top down
    eg ....



Bottom up(Tabulization)
-
