AVL TREE
    - complexity of searching in binary search tree =  O(no of levels of tree)
    - in skew(left/right) tree it will be = O(n)
    - To overcome this we have to construct AVL tree

RUles for AVL
    - BST TREE
    - |height right subtree - height of left| <= 1

Processes (Understand)
    - Left rotation
    - right rotation
    - Left Right rotation
    - Right Left rotation
