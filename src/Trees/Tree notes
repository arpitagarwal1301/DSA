Advantage over array linked list
1) Dynamic space (array fixed)
2) Searching time complexity less (linked list is of O(n) )

Binary tree
1) tree where nodes have 0,1,2 child nodes

Full binary tree
1) tree where nodes have 0,2 child nodes

Binary Search Tree
1) Left child < root node < right child

NOTE : inorder transversal for any binary search tree gives sorted order ascending

IMP** NOTE
-For solving trees consider root , leftsubtree and rightsubtree
-Firstly just consider 1 root node in the tree and
 figure out the exiting condition and then visualise with some cases with backtracking.

 total count == 1 + count(leftsubtree) + count(rightsubtree);
 total leafs == count(leftsubree)+count(rightsubtree);
