Strings Algorithms

BST of string
-Drawback - only searches the whole word instead of search by character
- so we use Trie to store words like in contacts of phone

Trie
- Used for dictionary , phone contacts etc
- use when we have to search character by character
- each node of trie will have 26 trie node
- leaf node to detect end of string for eg on inserting cat and cats -> t,s both are leaf
    in this trie if we search "ca" it will return false as we don't have a as leaf node

   -drawback
    -wastage of memory just inserting 'a' then we are wasting 25 spaces


Ternary Search Tree
- Used for Url autocompletion for eg on typing yahoo in url bar we get all suggestion like yahoo.com,yahoo.in etc
- used when we have to search word by word
- combination of BST and Trie
- left,right,eq
    if (next == null){
        create new
    }
    if(eq){
        move to next
    }
    if(next is greater ) then create in left
    if(next is lesser) then create in right
