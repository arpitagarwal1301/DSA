Advantages

1) optimal use of memory/no memory wastage(LOAD FACTOR AFTER 75% MEMORY INCREASE)
2) Insertion/Deletion in between elements is efficient
3) complexity
    search o(n)
    insertion O(1),O(N),O(N)
    deletion O(1),O(N),O(N)

Disadvantages

1) In Array we have only data but in linked list we store address also so extra space
2) Array has continuous addresses allocation while linked list every data point has different addresses
